      Throwback to 8th grade: February 2019

      For a class project, I needed to teach myself how to put together a robot
      which could do certain tasks (pick up ping pong balls and move them to a
      pedestal). At first this was very challenging because I had no prior
      experience and no assistance towards designing/wiring the robot. After
      researching, I really enjoyed the project. This project allowed me to have
      more interest into the STEM field and I love how my teacher made the class
      do it independently with trial and error.
